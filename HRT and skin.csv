This paper reviews how transgender healthcare, particularly hormone therapy and various surgical procedures, affects skin health. As more transgender people seek medical care, dermatologists need to understand the unique skin conditions these patients may experience.

The researchers found several distinct patterns of skin conditions based on transition direction:

For female-to-male (FTM) patients taking testosterone:
- Male-pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia)
- Acne
- Brittle nails
- Dry skin (xerosis)
- Eczema

For male-to-female (MTF) patients taking estrogen and testosterone blockers:
- Dark patches on the skin (melasma)
- An inflammatory skin condition called lichen planus
- A connective tissue disorder called systemic sclerosis
- Persistent unwanted facial hair despite hormone therapy
- Inflammation from ingrown facial hair (pseudofolliculitis barbae)
- Dry skin and eczema

The paper also identified several complications related to gender affirming surgeries and cosmetic procedures:
- Infections
- Existing skin conditions like psoriasis appearing along surgical scars (known as Koebnerization)
- Excessive scarring (hypertrophic and keloid scars)
- Skin cancer in surgically created genitalia
- Problems from silicone injections, including inflammatory nodules (siliconomas and granulomas)
- Swelling from silicone moving into the lymphatic system
- Skin problems from chest binding, including heat rash (miliaria), acne, and skin inflammation

The researchers conducted their review by searching PubMed (a major medical research database) using specific search terms related to transgender skin conditions, reviewing 67 relevant papers out of 196 initial results.

A key finding was that traditional treatments may need to be modified for transgender patients. For example, acne treatments that work by blocking testosterone wouldn't be appropriate for FTM patients who need testosterone for their transition. The paper also noted that careful monitoring is needed when using certain acne medications (like isotretinoin) in patients with mental health concerns.

The authors conclude that skin conditions in transgender patients are likely more common than current literature suggests, and that more research is needed. They emphasize that healthcare providers need to understand both the medical and psychological aspects of treating transgender patients to provide appropriate care.

Devkota21Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK and 2King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UKTransgender patients represent a growing proportion of the dermatology patient population owing to the consequences of hormonal treatments and unique complications from surgical and aesthetic interventions. This review serves to outline dermatological conditions reported in the literature within the transgender patient population and to raise awareness of this specific patient demographic. Patients who have transitioned, or are transitioning, often suffer skin disorders, whether attributable to or independent of their treatment for gender reassignment. Additionally, there can be both physiological and psychological complexities that require a holistic approach to treatment, and which may deem usual treatment options inappropriate; hormonal acne treatment targeting testosterone in female‐to‐male persons will be counterintuitive and contraindicated. Therefore, management of skin conditions in transgender patients often requires an alternate approach to conventional treatment, and it is pertinent that practitioner awareness is raised in order to continue to deliver appropriate care. A PubMed search using the term “transgender AND (skin OR dermato*)” returned 196 papers. These were reviewed for relevance with regard to dermatological issues and conditions in transgender patients; 67 of the 196 papers were deemed relevant. These were reviewed, and skin conditions and pathology reported within the literature were recorded. Medical concerns identified centred primarily around the impact of hormonal therapy. In female‐to‐male patients undergoing testosterone therapy, the following were noted: androgenic alopecia, acne, brittle nails, xerosis and eczema. In male‐to‐female patients undergoing oestrogen therapy and testosterone blockade melasma, lichen planus, systemic sclerosis, hormone‐resistant hirsutism, pseudofolliculitis barbae, eczema and xerosis were noted. Several papers discussed limitations in treatment options for hormonal acne and that isotretinoin may need to be used with caution, or with increased surveillance, in those with a significant mental health background. Complications arising from gender reassignment surgery included infection, Koebnerization of pre‐existing skin conditions such as psoriasis and lichen planus to surgical scars, hypertrophic and keloid scarring, and squamous cell carcinoma of surgically formed genitalia and within the neovaginal canal. Other conditions relating to aesthetic intervention included infection, siliconomas and granulomas associated with silicone injectables, lymphoedema due to lymphatic silicone migration, and adverse effects of chest binding such as miliaria, acne and dermatitis. Also noted was an increased requirement for hair‐removal therapies due to dissatisfaction with hormonally driven hair loss. The burden of dermatological disease in the transgender population is unique and likely substantial, with cases reported in the literature only a small representation of reality. Further research into this emerging area is valuable to further understand the prevalence of dermatological disease within the transgender population. It is vital for practitioners to appreciate the demographic‐specific concerns, treatment nuances and necessary holistic approach required to manage the dermatological concerns of this growing patient population.",2021-07-01,2024-12-08 06:50:13,2024-12-08 07:06:36,2024-12-08 06:50:13,76,,S1,185,,British Journal of Dermatology,BC01 (P44),,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,C:\Users\JJ\Zotero\storage\QLBXP9LX\2021 - BC01 (P44) Dermatological issues in the transgend.pdf; C:\Users\JJ\Zotero\storage\95HT8XT5\6599328.html,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reviews existing research about how menopause affects skin health and how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) might help address these changes. While not directly about transgender hormone therapy, its findings about how estrogen affects skin are relevant to understanding the effects of hormone therapy more broadly.

The researchers conducted a comprehensive review of medical literature by searching medical databases (Medline and Pubmed) for studies about collagen (a protein that gives skin its structure), elastin (a protein that gives skin its elasticity), estrogen, hormone replacement therapy, and skin aging.

Their key findings show that estrogen has several important effects on skin:
- It definitively increases collagen content (making skin thicker and stronger)
- It improves skin's dermal thickness (the deep layer of skin beneath the surface)
- It enhances skin elasticity (the skin's ability to stretch and bounce back)
- It appears to improve skin hydration, though more research is needed
- It may help wounds heal better, based on studies of how estrogen affects injury repair

However, the research found mixed or unclear results in several areas:
- How estrogen affects elastin levels in the skin
- Its impact on oil (sebaceous) production
- Its influence on wrinkling
- How it affects blood flow in the skin

The researchers conclude that while we know estrogen significantly affects skin health, we need more detailed research, particularly at the cellular level, to fully understand how hormone replacement therapy affects aging skin.

This research is relevant for understanding both menopausal HRT and transgender hormone therapy, as both involve changes in estrogen levels that can affect skin characteristics. However, it's important to note that this study specifically focused on post-menopausal women, and the effects might differ in other contexts.

Objective A review of the medical literature concerning the effect of the menopause and its hormonal treatment on the skin.

Methods An extensive Medline and Pubmed internet search utilizing the key words: collagen, elastin, estrogen, hormone replacement therapy, skin and aging.

Results The literature review demonstrated a wide array of research ranging from basic science work to clinical implications of the effects of the menopause and its treatment on the skin.

Conclusion Estrogen loss at menopause has a profound influence on skin. Estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women has been repeatedly shown to increase collagen content, dermal thickness and elasticity, and data on the effect of estrogen on skin water content are also promising. Further, physiologic studies on estrogen and wound healing suggest that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may play a beneficial role in cutaneous injury repair. Results on the effect of HRT on other physiologic characteristics of skin, such as elastin content, sebaceous secretions, wrinkling and blood flow, are discordant. Given the responsiveness of skin to estrogen, the effects of HRT on aging skin require further examination, and careful molecular studies will likely clarify estrogen's effects at the cellular level.",2005-06,2024-12-08 06:42:27,2024-12-08 06:42:27,2024-12-08 06:42:27,110-123,,2,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tandfonline.com (Atypon),,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,,,,,Acne; Aging; Estrogen; Hair loss; Physical characteristics; Skin; Skin cancer; Wound healing,,,,,,,

This paper reviews our current scientific understanding of how estrogens (hormones that include estradiol, the primary female sex hormone) affect the skin, highlighting both what we know and what remains unclear.

The researchers point out that while we've known for a long time that estrogens significantly impact skin, there hasn't been enough research in this area. They explain that estrogens affect virtually every part of the skin, including:
- The epidermis (outer layer of skin)
- The dermis (deeper layer containing connective tissue)
- Blood vessels in the skin
- Hair follicles
- Various types of glands:
  * Sebaceous glands (which produce oil)
  * Eccrine glands (which produce sweat)
  * Apocrine glands (which produce thicker, scented secretions)

The paper highlights how estrogens influence several key aspects of skin health and function:
- Aging processes in the skin
- Skin pigmentation (coloring)
- Hair growth patterns
- How much oil the skin produces
- Skin cancer development

A key focus of the paper is on recent discoveries that have made understanding estrogen's effects more complex. Scientists have found:
1. A second type of estrogen receptor (ER?) inside cells, which works differently from the previously known receptor (ERα)
2. Additional estrogen receptors on the surface of cells

These discoveries suggest that estrogen's effects on skin are more complicated than previously thought, with different receptors potentially causing different responses in different types of skin cells.

The authors argue that we need to revisit many basic questions about how estrogens affect skin, particularly given these new discoveries about estrogen receptors. This research could help develop better treatments for skin conditions involving abnormal estrogen responses.

For those interested in hormone therapy effects on skin, this paper is particularly relevant as it outlines the many ways estrogen influences skin health and appearance, though it wasn't specifically focused on hormone therapy applications.

</explanation>","Abstract: There is still extensive disparity in our understanding of how estrogens exert their actions, particularly in non-reproductive tissues such as the skin. Although it has been recognized for some time that estrogens have significant effects on many aspects of skin physiology and pathophysiology, studies on estrogen action in skin have been limited. However, estrogens clearly have an important function in many components of human skin including the epidermis, dermis, vasculature, hair follicle and the sebaceous, eccrine and apocrine glands, having significant roles in skin aging, pigmentation, hair growth, sebum production and skin cancer. The recent discovery of a second intracellular estrogen receptor (ER?) with different cell-specific roles to the classic estrogen receptor (ERα), and the identification of cell surface estrogen receptors, has provided further challenges to understanding the mechanism of estrogen action. It is now time to readdress many of the outstanding questions regarding the role of estrogens in skin and improve our understanding of the physiology and interaction of steroid hormones and their receptors in human skin. Not only will this lead to a better understanding of estrogen action, but may also provide a basis for further interventions in pathological processes that involve dysregulation of estrogen action.",2002-12,2024-12-08 06:42:04,2024-12-08 06:42:04,2024-12-08 06:42:04,487-502,,6,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,,,,estrogen receptors; hair follicle; melanocytes; sebaceous gland; skin,,,,,,,

This paper examines how estrogen levels affect skin health, particularly focusing on what happens when estrogen levels decline with age in women. This topic is particularly relevant for understanding skin changes during menopause and has implications for hormone therapy effects on skin.

The paper explains that estrogen, which is a type of C-18 steroid hormone made from cholesterol, is produced in two different ways: before menopause, it's mainly made in the ovaries, but after menopause, it's produced in various peripheral tissues throughout the body. The body has two different types of estrogen receptors (called α and β) that are found in various tissues, allowing estrogen to affect different parts of the body.

The research finds several specific effects of lowered estrogen levels on skin:
- The skin becomes drier
- Skin tissue becomes thinner (atrophy)
- Fine wrinkles develop
- Wounds heal more slowly
- Hot flashes occur
- The amount of collagen (a protein that gives skin its structure) in the deeper skin layer decreases
- Skin becomes less elastic
- Skin moisture levels drop

Importantly, the paper notes that many of these changes can be improved or reversed through estrogen supplementation, though it doesn't specify in the abstract exactly which changes respond best to treatment.

This research is particularly relevant for understanding how hormone levels affect skin health, not just in post-menopausal women but potentially in anyone experiencing significant changes in estrogen levels. While the paper focuses on age-related estrogen decline, its findings about how estrogen affects skin characteristics could help explain skin changes observed in other contexts where estrogen levels change significantly.

The paper appears to be structured as an educational review, with a specific learning objective for medical professionals to understand estrogen's relationship with skin health, including both the biological mechanisms and the practical effects of estrogen supplementation.

</explanation>","Aging is associated with declining levels of several hormones, including estrogen. Although the effects of estrogen on the skin are still not fully understood, it is known that, in women, declining estrogen levels are associated with a variety of cutaneous changes, many of which can be reversed or improved by estrogen supplementation. Estrogens are C-18 steroids synthesized from cholesterol in the ovary premenopausally and in the peripheral tissue in postmenopausal women. Two estrogen receptors, α and β, have been cloned and found in various tissue types. Studies of postmenopausal women indicate that estrogen deprivation is associated with dryness, atrophy, fine wrinkling, poor healing, and hot flashes. Epidermal thinning, declining dermal collagen content, diminished skin moisture, decreased laxity, and impaired wound healing have been reported in postmenopausal women. This article reviews the effects of declining estrogen levels on the skin and the effects of estrogen supplementation.

This paper explores how estrogen affects skin health, with a particular focus on what happens to skin when estrogen levels change, as occurs during menopause. While estrogen's effects on many body systems are well-known, its impact on skin has been less thoroughly studied.

The researchers found several key ways that estrogen helps maintain healthy skin:

1. Collagen maintenance: Estrogen helps prevent the loss of collagen (a protein that gives skin its structure and firmness) in postmenopausal women. Both topical (applied to skin) and systemic (taken as medication) estrogen can increase collagen levels and maintain skin thickness.

2. Moisture retention: Estrogen helps keep skin hydrated in two ways:
   - It increases substances called acid mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid (molecules that help skin retain moisture)
   - It may help maintain the skin's protective outer barrier (called the stratum corneum)

3. Oil production: Women receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have higher levels of sebum (skin oil) compared to those not on HRT.

4. Wrinkle prevention: Estrogen appears to help prevent wrinkles by maintaining both elastic fibers (which give skin its ability to bounce back) and collagen.

Beyond aging, estrogen also plays a role in wound healing. It regulates cytokines (proteins that help control inflammation and healing), and applying estrogen directly to wounds can speed up healing in older adults of both sexes.

Interestingly, when it comes to scarring, the relationship is less clear. Some studies suggest that having less estrogen, or blocking its effects with drugs like tamoxifen, might actually improve scar quality.

The paper notes that while estrogen's role in skin aging is becoming clear, its relationship to melanoma (a serious","As the population of postmenopausal women increases, interest in the effects of estrogen grows. The influence of estrogen on several body systems has been well-documented; however, one area that has not been explored is the effects of estrogen on skin. Estrogen appears to aid in the prevention of skin aging in several ways. This reproductive hormone prevents a decrease in skin collagen in postmenopausal women; topical and systemic estrogen therapy can increase the skin collagen content and therefore maintain skin thickness. In addition, estrogen maintains skin moisture by increasing acid mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid in the skin and possibly maintaining stratum corneum barrier function. Sebum levels are higher in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy. Skin wrinkling also may benefit from estrogen as a result of the effects of the hormone on the elastic fibers and collagen. Outside of its influence on skin aging, it has been suggested that estrogen increases cutaneous wound healing by regulating the levels of a cytokine. In fact, topical estrogen has been found to accelerate and improve wound healing in elderly men and women. The role of estrogen in scarring is unclear but recent studies indicate that the lack of estrogen or the addition of tamoxifen may improve the quality of scarring. Unlike skin aging, the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogen in melanoma has not been well established.",2001-06-01,2024-12-08 06:09:01,2024-12-08 06:09:01,2024-12-08 06:09:01,143-150,,3,2,,Am J Clin Dermatol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,Estrogen; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Hyaluronic Acid; Melanoma; Postmenopausal Woman,,,,,,,

This paper is a comprehensive review of existing medical literature about dermatology (skin care and skin conditions) specifically as it relates to transgender patients. The researchers recognized that transgender individuals have unique skin-related medical needs that may differ from cisgender patients, but noticed that there wasn't much organized medical literature addressing these specific needs.

The researchers conducted what's called a ""systematic review,"" which means they gathered and analyzed all the existing peer-reviewed research they could find on this topic. They found 110 articles that met their criteria for inclusion in their review. However, they noted an important limitation: most of the available research consisted of case reports (detailed studies of individual patients) and expert opinions, rather than larger-scale quantitative studies that would provide more robust statistical evidence.

The paper appears to be primarily aimed at dermatologists, highlighting that they can play an important role in transgender healthcare. The authors suggest that there are many opportunities for dermatologists to contribute new research about transgender skin care and treatment.

This review is particularly significant because it helps establish a foundation for future research and medical education about transgender dermatology. By gathering all the existing literature in one place, it helps identify what we already know about transgender dermatology care and, importantly, where there are gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled with new research.

The abstract doesn't provide specific findings about particular skin conditions or treatments, suggesting that this paper is more focused on surveying the current state of knowledge and identifying areas where more research is needed, rather than making specific clinical recommendations.

This study investigated how gender affects pain during and after getting a tattoo, along with several other factors that might influence tattoo-related pain. The researchers collected data from 1,092 people (863 women and 229 men) who received tattoos.

The main findings were interesting: 
- During the actual tattooing process, men and women experienced similar levels of pain
- After the tattoo was completed, women reported higher pain levels than men
- Several factors were found to increase pain during tattooing:
  * Longer tattooing time
  * More bleeding
  * Higher stress levels
  * Taking pain medication before the procedure (which might indicate these individuals were already more sensitive to pain)
- Similar factors increased pain after the tattoo was finished:
  * Longer tattooing time
  * More bleeding
  * Higher stress levels

The researchers used statistical methods called ""multiple regression analyses"" and ""multiple logistic regression analyses"" to examine how different factors related to pain levels. These are sophisticated statistical tools that help determine which factors truly influence an outcome (in this case, pain) while accounting for other variables that might affect the results.

The study used a survey to collect information about participants' experiences, including details about the tattoo location, type of pain felt, duration of the procedure, bleeding, stress levels, use of pain medications, and for women, their menstrual cycle phase.

This research is valuable for both tattoo artists and clients, as it helps identify factors that might make the tattooing experience more painful. It's particularly noteworthy that gender itself doesn't affect pain during the procedure, though it does influence pain afterwards. This information could help tattoo artists better prepare their clients for what to expect and potentially develop strategies to minimize pain factors they can control, such as managing stress levels or considering session duration.

</explanation>","Background: The aim of the research was to analyse the impact of gender on pain perception during and directly after tattooing, with the following predictors as covariates: the body area chosen for a tattoo, the character of the pain, the time it takes to complete the tattoo, bleeding, the level of stress, analgesics taken before the tattooing procedure, and the cycle phase. Methods: A total of 1092 participants took part in this study (F: 863, M: 229).

This paper examines how estrogen hormones affect skin health and appearance, with particular focus on what happens when estrogen levels drop during menopause. This research is relevant both for understanding age-related skin changes and for hormone therapy effects.

The key findings show that estrogen affects skin in several specific ways:
- It increases both the amount and quality of collagen (the protein that gives skin its structure and firmness)
- It makes skin thicker
- It improves blood vessel development in the skin
- It enhances the extracellular matrix (the support structure between cells that helps maintain skin's tone and appearance)
- It extends the growth cycle of hair follicles

The researchers found that estrogen receptors (specialized proteins that respond to estrogen) exist throughout the skin, but their concentration varies depending on body location. This helps explain why estrogen's effects on skin can differ across different parts of the body.

Importantly, the paper notes that skin aging isn't solely dependent on estrogen levels. Environmental factors (like sun exposure and pollution) and natural aging processes also play major roles in how skin changes over time.

The research has direct clinical applications: it shows that estrogen replacement therapy can help reverse skin-related changes caused by low estrogen levels. While the paper focuses on post-menopausal hormone therapy, these findings are also relevant for understanding how hormone therapy might affect skin in other contexts, such as transgender healthcare.

The authors note that newer research techniques are enabling better understanding of how estrogen affects skin cells, suggesting this is an active area of ongoing research.

</explanation>","Estrogens have a profound influence on skin. The hypoestrogenism occurring after the menopause leads to measured deterioration in the skin. Estrogen receptors have been identified in the skin and the concentration of these receptors varies in the different parts of the body. Estrogen improves skin in more than one way, the collagen content and quality is improved, skin thickness is increased, while vascularisation is enhanced. The extracellular matrix responsible for the tone and appearance of the skin is also improved. It is not just the skin that shows an improvement with estrogen therapy but also skin appendages, such as hair. Estrogens have been shown to increase the hair follicle life cycle. Skin aging is not totally estrogen dependent because the ravages of age and the external environment play very important roles. The effects of estrogen on skin need further elucidation and with the emergence of newer techniques it is now possible to study more clearly the changes occurring at the cellular level. Estrogen replacement reverses the deleterious effect of estrogen deprivation on the skin, which is thus yet another organ that benefits from hormone replacement therapy.",2000-05-29,2024-12-08 06:42:05,2024-12-08 06:42:05,2024-12-08 06:42:05,107-117,,2,35,,Maturitas,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\JJ\Zotero\storage\F2DLHIKL\S0378512200000979.html,,,Estrogens; Hormone replacement therapy; Skin,,,,,,,

This paper examines differences in blood vessel patterns in facial skin between different genders, specifically in the context of face-lift surgery (rhytidectomy). The research was motivated by the observation that complications involving blood collection under the skin (hematomas) after face-lifts occur at different rates depending on gender.

The researchers compared three groups of patients undergoing face-lifts: cisgender women, transgender women (male-to-female), and men. They looked at skin samples from two areas: in front of the ear (pre-auricular) and behind the ear (post-auricular). To measure blood vessel density, they used a special stain called CD-31 that highlights blood vessel walls, then calculated what percentage of the tissue contained blood vessels.

Key findings:
- All groups had more blood vessels behind the ear than in front of it (about 0.36 percentage points higher)
- Behind the ear, there was a clear gender pattern: men had the highest blood vessel density (2.77%), followed by transgender women (2.16%), and then cisgender women (1.60%)
- In front of the ear, there was no significant difference in blood vessel density between groups
- Two other factors were linked to higher blood vessel density in front of the ear: having high blood pressure and having had hair removal procedures

This research helps explain why different groups might have different risks during face-lift surgery. The finding that transgender women's blood vessel patterns fall between those of cisgender men and women is particularly notable, as it could help surgeons better understand and manage surgical risks for transgender patients.

The study used rigorous methods, including pixel-based measurement of blood vessel density and statistical analysis to confirm that gender was a strong predictor of blood vessel patterns, particularly behind the ear. This kind of detailed anatomical understanding is crucial for improving surgical outcomes and reducing complications.

While the abstract doesn't explicitly state clinical recommendations, these findings could help surgeons better prepare for and prevent complications during face-lift procedures, particularly in patients who might be at higher risk for bleeding complications.

</explanation>","Importance: The risk of hematoma formation after rhytidectomy is gender associated and can lead to postoperative complications. The literature to help explain and elucidate the mechanism behind this gender-associated risk is poorly developed and requires further investigation. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare facial skin micro-vessel density of female and male-to-female (MTF) transgender patients undergoing rhytidectomy to better understand the mechanism of gender-correlated hematoma risk factors. The authors hypothesized that transgender patients would have higher micro-vessel density compared with female patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective histopathological analysis of pre- and post-auricular facial skin samples from patients undergoing primary rhytidectomy. Patient clinical data and skin samples were collected. Histopathological slides were prepared and stained with CD-31, a marker of vessel endothelium, followed by image analysis allowing for micro-vessel stained pixel counts and calculated pixel density comparisons at a single academic hospital. Female, MTF transgender, and male patients >18 years of age were studied. Exposure: Patients undergoing primary rhytidectomy between 2015 and 2018. Main Outcomes: Gender-associated pre- and post-auricular micro-vessel pixel density. Results: Forty-one patients contributed skin samples for analysis. Post-auricular micro-vessel pixel density was greater than pre-auricular density (mean difference post–pre 0.359 percentage points [p.p.], standard error [SE] = 0.135, p = 0.009). The mean post-auricular micro-vessel pixel density was 1.60% (SE = 0.13 p.p.), 2.16% (SE = 0.19 p.p.), and 2.77% (SE = 0.34 p.p.) for female, transgender, and male patients, respectively (p = 0.016). Pre-auricular micro-vessel pixel density showed no difference among females, males, and transgender patients (p = 0.30). Gender was a strong predictor of increased post-auricular micro-vessel pixel density on stepwise linear regression, but it did not predict pre-auricular micro-vessel density. Both preoperative hair removal and a history of hypertension were associated with increased pre-auricular micro-vessel density. Conclusions and Relevance: Facial skin micro-vessel density differs by gender, in addition to pre- and post-auricular locations in patients undergoing rhytidectomy.",2021-06,2024-12-08 06:42:10,2024-12-08 06:42:10,2024-12-08 06:42:10,199-204,,3,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,liebertpub.com (Atypon),,"Publisher: Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers",,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reviews how hormone therapy and gender transition affect skin health in transgender individuals, and discusses why transgender patients might need dermatological (skin-related) care. The authors note that while endocrinology journals have covered these topics, dermatology literature has largely overlooked them.

The paper highlights several key areas where dermatologists intersect with transgender healthcare:

1. Hormone Therapy Effects:
- Changes in sebum (natural skin oil) production
- Alterations in hair growth patterns
- Development of acne
These changes occur because hormone therapy fundamentally alters the body's endocrine (hormone) system, which directly affects skin and hair.

2. Specific Dermatological Concerns:
- Permanent hair removal procedures
- Androgenic alopecia (hormone-related hair loss, similar to male pattern baldness)
- Scar management following gender-affirming surgeries like breast reduction or genital reassignment

Historically, transgender healthcare has been primarily handled by mental health providers, endocrinologists (hormone specialists), and surgeons specializing in gender reassignment procedures. However, the authors argue that dermatologists play an important role in transgender healthcare that deserves more attention.

The paper aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for dermatologists who treat transgender patients, whether they're currently transitioning or have completed their transition. This suggests that the medical community is recognizing the need for more specialized knowledge about caring for transgender patients across all medical specialties, not just those traditionally associated with gender transition.

</explanation>","Literature is limited regarding the medical and cosmetic dermatologic issues pertinent to transgender patients and the reasons why 19 transgender individuals seek care from dermatologists. Clinical management of this population has historically been limited to 20 mental health providers, endocrinologists, and select surgeons with expertise in sex reassignment surgery. The impact of hormonal 21 therapy on transgender skin has been well documented in endocrinology journals, but is underrepresented in dermatology 22 literature. Hormonal therapy leads to drastic skin alterations, impacting sebum production, hair growth, and acne, all of which may 23 become a dermatologic concern for the transgender patient. Dermatologists may also be consulted regarding issues such as 24 permanent hair removal, androgenic alopecia, or scar revision following breast reduction surgery or genital reassignment surgery. 25 The purpose of this review is to provide relevant information for use by all dermatology providers who care for transgender 26 patients or patients undergoing transition.",2016,2024-12-08 06:42:08,2024-12-08 06:42:08,2024-12-08 06:42:08,,,10,22,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,escholarship.org,,,,C:\Users\JJ\Zotero\storage\YQE4V9AM\Hermosura Almazan e Kabigting - 2016 - Dermatologic care of the transgender patient.pdf,,,,,,,,,,

This study looked at how testosterone (T) therapy affects the skin of transgender men (people transitioning from female to male), focusing on three main areas: acne, body/facial hair growth, and male-pattern baldness. The researchers wanted to understand both the immediate effects and long-term impacts of testosterone treatment.

The study was conducted in two parts:
1. Following 20 trans men who were just starting testosterone therapy, tracking changes over their first year
2. Examining 50 trans men who had been on testosterone for about 10 years

Here are the key findings:

Body and Facial Hair:
- Hair growth increased steadily throughout the first year of treatment
- They measured this using the Ferriman and Gallwey scale (a standardized way to measure hair growth patterns)
- The median score went from 0.5 before treatment to 12 after one year
- After long-term treatment, almost all participants developed hair patterns that would be considered ""hirsute"" (excessive hair growth) in women, with a median score of 24

Male-Pattern Baldness:
- Only one person showed mild hairline recession in the first year
- After long-term treatment, about one-third (32.7%) had mild hairline recession
- Another third (31%) developed moderate to severe male-pattern baldness

Acne:
- Acne increased during the first year, reaching its worst point at 6 months
- After long-term treatment, most participants (93.9%) had either no acne or only mild acne
- Severe acne was not observed in either short or long-term groups

Importantly, the researchers found that these skin changes weren't directly related to the amount of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (a hormone derived from testosterone) in each person's blood. This suggests that individual responses to testosterone therapy vary, regardless of hormone levels.

This research provides valuable information for healthcare providers and trans men about what skin changes to expect during testosterone therapy, both immediately and over the long term. It shows that while some effects like hair growth are progressive, others like acne tend to peak and then improve over time.

The F&amp;G score increased progressively from a median value of 0.5 at baseline to a value of 12 after 12 months of T administration. After long‐term T treatment, all but one trans man achieved an F&amp;G score indicative of hirsutism in women, with a median value of 24. Only one trans man acquired mild frontotemporal hair loss during the first year of T treatment, whereas 32.7% of trans men had mild frontotemporal hair loss and 31% had moderate to severe androgenetic alopecia after long‐term T therapy.

This study looked at how hormone therapy affects skin and hair changes in transgender people, with a particular focus on comparing different types of testosterone treatments.

The researchers followed 484 transgender people (291 who were assigned female at birth and 193 who were assigned male at birth) for 12 months after they started hormone therapy. They measured three main things:
1. Body and facial hair growth using the Ferriman-Gallwey score (a standardized way to measure hair growth patterns)
2. Acne severity using the Global Acne Grading Scale
3. Hair loss patterns using the Norwood Hamilton scale (which measures male-pattern baldness)

The key findings were:
- For people assigned female at birth taking testosterone:
  * They experienced more body/facial hair growth
  * They developed more acne
  * Some began showing male-pattern hair loss
  * The form of testosterone made a difference: injectable testosterone (both undecanoate and ester forms) caused more hair growth than testosterone gel
  * Injectable testosterone also led to more acne than gel forms

- For people assigned male at birth (typically taking estrogen and testosterone blockers):
  * They experienced less body and facial hair growth
  * However, after 12 months, about half still had significant body/facial hair (defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey score above 8)

This research is particularly valuable because it compares different forms of testosterone treatment (gels vs. injections) and their varying effects on skin and hair changes. This information could help healthcare providers and patients make more informed decisions about hormone therapy options based on their desired outcomes and concerns about side effects.

The study's detailed tracking of these changes over a full year, with measurements at the start, 6 months, and 12 months, provides a clear picture of how these changes develop over time during hormone therapy.
</explanation>","Purpose  The aim of our study was to assess dermatological changes in transgender people after the start of gender-affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT) and to investigate whether various hormonal preparations differently affect dermatological changes in trans AFAB (assigned female at birth) people. Methods  In a multicenter prospective study, 484 participants (193 assigned male at birth/AMAB and 291 AFAB) were evaluated at baseline (T0), 6 (T1) and 12 months (T2) after the start of GAHT. Hair growth was assessed by the Ferriman–Gallwey (FG) score, acne by the Global Acne Grading Scale (GAGS), and alopecia by the Norwood Hamilton (NH) score. Results  In AFAB people, a significant increase in FG score and NH grade was observed across time, as well as in GAGS score in a subsample of 71 individuals (p < 0.001). Testosterone (T) undecanoate and esters showed a higher increase in hair distribution at T2 vs. T1 as compared to T gel (p < 0.01). T esters showed a significantly higher impact in GAGS score modifications at T1 and at T2 vs. T0 compared to T gel (p = 0.021 and p = 0.003, respectively). In trans AMAB people, a significant decrease of FG score was observed across time (p < 0.001), although 51.3% of individuals still reported an FG score higher than eight after 12 months.

This 1970s study investigated how removing ovaries (castration) and subsequent estrogen treatment affects skin thickness and cell growth in humans. This research is particularly relevant for understanding how sex hormones influence skin health and how estrogen therapy can affect skin characteristics.

The researchers studied 167 patients and took 557 skin biopsies, making over 2,300 measurements. They also specifically studied cell growth in 12 women with regular menstrual cycles using a technique called 3H-thymidine incorporation (a method that labels actively dividing cells).

Key findings:
1. After ovary removal:
- The skin (specifically the epidermis, the outer layer) became progressively thinner over time
- One month after surgery, skin thickness was similar to pre-surgery levels
- By seven months, 55% of patients had significantly thinner skin
- Cell division (measured by ""labelling indices"") dropped notably after one month, and while it partially recovered, remained below pre-surgery levels

2. Effects of estrogen treatment:
- Patients received either estriolsuccinate or estradiolvalerate (two forms of estrogen) at 2mg daily doses, starting one month after surgery
- After three months of estriolsuccinate, 62% of patients showed significantly thicker skin
- Estradiolvalerate showed similar results initially, but after six months, some patients (24%) showed skin thinning compared to their three-month measurements
- The researchers concluded that for long-term positive effects, estrogen levels shouldn't be too high

3. Important correlations:
- When patients were on estrogen therapy, there was a positive correlation between skin thickness, cell division rates, and urinary estrogen levels
- Before treatment, these correlations weren't present

The study conclusively showed that oral estrogen therapy can promote skin cell growth, prevent skin thinning, and even reverse existing thinning. Importantly, they found no cases where estrogen therapy caused skin thinning or stopped cell division, confirming earlier research findings from smaller studies.

This research helps explain why estrogen therapy can affect skin characteristics and provides evidence for its role in maintaining skin health. The findings are particularly relevant for understanding skin changes in various contexts where estrogen levels are altered, whether through medical procedures, hormone therapy, or natural processes like menopause.
</explanation>","The skin effect of castration and peroral estrogen
therapy was studied in 167 patients. In addition,
3H-thymidine incorporation of the epidermis was
studied in 12 women with a regular menstrual
cycle. The total of skin biopsies taken was 557,
of planimetric measurements performed 2345.
Autoradiograms were made of 165 skin samples.
The epidermis became thinner on average the
longer the time from castration. One month
after castration the epidermal thickness generally
did not differ significantly from the preopera-
tive specimen. Seven months after castration
the epidermis was statistically significantly
( p < 0.01 ) thinner than in the preoperative
specimens in 55 per cent. A distinct drop in the
labelling indices was seen one month after
castration. After this, the labelling indices
gradually increased, but kept below the preo-
perative level. There was no statistically sig-
nificant correlation between epidermal thickness
and the labelling indices, nor between the
thickness of the epidermis and urinary estrogen
excretion.
The peroral estrogen therapy consisted of
estriolsuccinate or estradiolvalerate; the 24-hour
dose of both was 2 mg. The administration was
begun one month after castration and continued
for six months. After three months of estriol-
succinate therapy the epidermis was statistically
significantly ( p < 0.01 ) thickened in 62 per
cent of the cases. In most of the cases no signifisant difference was seen between the three- and
six-month specimens. The labelling indices were
significantly higher after three and six months
of estriolsuccinate therapy than a t the time
therapy was instituted.
The result for estradiolvalerate resembled that
for estriolsuccinate. However, the epidermis
was statistically significantly ( p < 0.01 ) thinner
in 24 per cent of the cases in the six- than in
the three-month specimens, and it was almost
significantly ( p < 0.05) thinner in 12 per cent
of the cases. I t is thus apparent that for a
sustained favourable skin effect continuous long-
term estrogen effect must not be very strong.
A significant positive correlation was estab-
lished between epidermal thickness and the
labelling indices and epidermal thickness a d
urinary estrogen excretion both in the estriol-
succinate and in the estradiolvalerate groups.
I n not a single case did estrogen therapy
exert an atrophying effect on the epidermis, and
no inhibition of mitosis was observed. It seems
evident from this study that peroral estrogen
therapy is capable of causing epidermal pro-
liferation. Atrophy of the epidermis can thus
be prevented in this way and atrophy that has
already originated can be eliminated. The results
of the investigation confirmed in all respects

and Punnonen (1969 and 1971) on smaller

This paper explores how sex hormones (androgens like testosterone, and estrogens) are produced and function in human skin, which is particularly relevant for understanding both common skin conditions and hormone therapy effects.

The key findings include:

1. Skin itself can produce sex hormones locally, rather than just receiving them from the bloodstream. This happens mainly in sebaceous glands (which produce skin oils) and sweat glands. While these skin cells can't create androgens from scratch, they can convert weaker forms into stronger ones like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

2. Androgens affect several skin functions:
- Control of oil gland size and activity
- Hair growth patterns
- Maintenance of the skin's protective barrier
- Wound healing
These effects occur when androgens bind to specific proteins called androgen receptors in cells.

3. Estrogens influence:
- Skin aging processes
- Skin pigmentation
- Hair growth
- Oil production
- Skin cancer risk
They work through two different mechanisms: either by binding to receptors inside cells (ERalpha and ERbeta, which are distributed differently in different skin areas) or by activating signals at the cell surface.

4. The paper also discusses treatment approaches for hormone-related skin conditions:
- Combined estrogen-progestin treatments (like birth control pills) can help with excess hair growth and acne by reducing the body's androgen production
- These treatments can cut down required shaving by 50% and stop excessive hair growth from getting worse
- Two specific anti-androgen medications, cyproterone acetate and spironolactone, are effective for treating excess hair growth, though individual results vary

This research is particularly relevant for understanding how hormone therapy might affect skin, hair growth, and oil production, as it details the specific mechanisms by which different sex hormones influence these features. It also explains why certain medications used in hormone therapy might have particular skin-related effects or side effects.

</explanation>","The skin locally synthesizes significant amounts of sexual hormones with intracrine or paracrine actions. The local level of each sexual steroid depends upon the expression of each of the androgen- and estrogen-synthesizing enzymes in each cell type, with sebaceous glands and sweat glands being the major contributors. Sebocytes express very little of the key enzyme, cytochrome P450c17, necessary for synthesis of the androgenic prohormones dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, however, these prohormones can be converted by sebocytes and sweat glands, and probably also by dermal papilla cells, into more potent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Five major enzymes are involved in the activation and deactivation of androgens in skin. Androgens affect several functions of human skin, such as sebaceous gland growth and differentiation, hair growth, epidermal barrier homeostasis and wound healing. Their effects are mediated by binding to the nuclear androgen receptor. Changes of isoenzyme and/or androgen receptor levels may have important implications in the development of hyperandrogenism and the associated skin diseases such as acne, seborrhoea, hirsutism and androgenetic alopecia. On the other hand, estrogens have been implicated in skin aging, pigmentation, hair growth, sebum production and skin cancer. Estrogens exert their actions through intracellular receptors or via cell surface receptors, which activate specific second messenger signaling pathways. Recent studies suggest specific site-related distribution of ERalpha and ERbeta in human skin. In contrast, progestins play no role in the pathogenesis of skin disorders. However, they play a major role in the treatment of hirsutism and acne vulgaris, where they are prescribed as components of estrogen-progestin combination pills and as anti-androgens. These combinations enhance gonadotropin suppression of ovarian androgen production. Estrogen-progestin treatment can reduce the need for shaving by half and arrest progression of hirsutism of various etiologies, but do not necessarily reverse it. However, they reliably reduce acne. Cyproterone acetate and spironolactone are similarly effective as anti-androgens in reducing hirsutism, although there is wide variability in individual responses.",2007-02,2024-12-08 06:06:25,2024-12-08 06:06:25,,85-95,,2,39,,Horm Metab Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 17326004,,; C:\Users\JJ\Zotero\storage\4F7KI8M3\Zouboulis et al. - 2007 - Sexual hormones in human skin.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326004,,"Aromatase; Eccrine Glands; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hair Follicle; Humans; Hypogonadism; Keratinocytes; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Receptors, Androgen; Sebaceous Glands; Skin; Skin Diseases; Skin Physiological Phenomena",,,,,,,

This study investigated how sex hormones affect hair growth and oil production in the skin by studying transgender individuals undergoing hormone therapy. This provided a unique opportunity to observe how these features change when hormones are deliberately altered.

The researchers followed two groups: 21 transgender women (male-to-female) and 17 transgender men (female-to-male) who were receiving hormone therapy. They tracked several specific characteristics over 12 months:
- Hair growth patterns using a standardized scoring system (Ferriman-Gallwey score)
- Acne levels using a clinical classification system (Leeds classification)
- Detailed hair measurements including growth rate, density (hairs per area), and thickness
- Skin oil (sebum) production using a special tape test (Sebutape)

Key findings:
1. For transgender women receiving estrogen and anti-androgens:
- Their testosterone levels dropped to very low levels (below 1.0 nmol/L)
- All hair growth and oil production decreased
- Facial hair continued to grow, though more slowly
- Hair shaft thickness decreased first (within 4 months), followed by slower changes in hair length and density

2. For transgender men receiving testosterone:
- Both hair growth rate and skin oil production increased
- After a full year, the hair thickness on their face and abdomen still hadn't reached typical male levels

Interestingly, the researchers found that a specific hormone metabolite (5alpha-Androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol glucuronide) showed only weak connections to hair growth and oil production, despite being traditionally associated with these features.

The study reveals that hormone therapy affects different aspects of hair growth at different rates, and that even when male hormones (androgens) are almost completely blocked, some hair growth continues, just more slowly. It also shows that developing male-pattern hair growth takes longer than 12 months of testosterone therapy, suggesting this is a gradual, long-term process.

These findings are particularly relevant for understanding hormone therapy effects in transgender individuals and could help set realistic expectations for physical changes during transition.

- Androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss)
- Xerosis (abnormally dry skin)
- Pruritus (intense itching)
- Persistent hirsutism (excessive hair growth)
- Atopic dermatitis (a type of eczema causing red, itchy skin)
- Melasma (patches of darker skin coloration)

They also found that TGD people who undergo gender-affirming surgeries may be at risk for developing hypertrophic scars (raised, thick scars) and keloids (overgrown scar tissue that extends beyond the original injury).

The research team conducted a systematic review, which means they thoroughly analyzed existing research on this topic. They examined 22 studies, finding that most of the substantial research has been done quite recently - since 2019. Before that, most information came from individual case reports and expert opinions rather than comprehensive studies. They used established research guidelines (PRISMA) and had two independent reviewers assess the studies to ensure quality.

The paper concludes that healthcare professionals, particularly dermatologists, can play an important role in improving care for TGD patients. Rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, the authors recommend that skin-related treatments should be tailored to individual patients. This is particularly important because treating these skin conditions can significantly improve quality of life and mental health for TGD individuals - issues that have often been overlooked or inadequately addressed in healthcare settings.

The paper aims to provide practical guidance for healthcare professionals, addressing what has been an understudied area of transgender healthcare despite its importance to patients' wellbeing.

</explanation>","Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people face specific dermatological conditions related to the cutaneous effects of gender affirming medical treatment (GAMT). Dermatological conditions in TGD people are often underdiagnosed and underrecognized despite its potential for treatment to improve quality of life and mental health in this population. There is paucity of literature guiding health care professionals (HCP), including dermatologists, regarding the dermatological aspects that TGD people can experience during medical transition. To conduct a systematic review summarizing and critically appraising the literature describing the dermatological changes in TGD people following gender affirming medical transition. To develop recommendations for health care professionals regarding the dermatological conditions identified in the review. Studies were identified through Google Scholar, PubMed databases, as well as through Google Scholar search alerts. We considered all studies published until February 2024. PICO questions were developed based on the aims of the review. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Two reviewers extracted data from suitable studies and also independently assessed the identified studies’ risk of bias and strength of evidence. A total of 22 research studies were included in the systematic review. Prior to 2019 most of the available literature relied on case reports and expert opinions. The vast majority of studies and reviews were published in the last 5 years. Gender affirming hormone treatment may cause or affect particular skin conditions such as acne, androgenic alopecia, xerosis, pruritus, persistent hirsutism, atopic dermatitis and melasma. In addition, TGD people undergoing gender affirming surgical treatment are at risk for hypertrophic scar and keloid development. Health care professionals (HCP), including dermatologists have the ability to positively affect the dermatological care of transgender and gender diverse patients. Guidance and several recommendations are made for health care professionals regarding future prevention strategies and treatment that are patient-tailored rather than using an universal approach.",,2024-12-08 06:05:24,2024-12-08 06:06:15,2024-12-08 06:05:23,1-18,,0,0,,,Dermatological aspects of gender affirming medical treatment in transgender and gender diverse people,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/26895269.2024.2374890,,C:\Users\JJ\Zotero\storage\GWLZABMI\Arcelus et al. - Dermatological aspects of gender affirming medical.pdf,,,Dermatology; gender-affirming medical treatment; PRISMA; systematic review; transgender and gender diverse,,,,,,,
